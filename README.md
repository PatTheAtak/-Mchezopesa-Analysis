## Description
In this project I sought to understand the football rankings by solving for the research question. 
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below. 
A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, 
and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training). 
You have two possible approaches (as shown below) given the datasets that will be provided

## Approach 1: Polynomial Regression

What to train given:

Rank of home team Rank of away team Tournament type Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

## Approach 2: Logistic Regression
Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home team’s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
